# VR-Disc-Golf

A Demo build of Virtual Reality Disc Golf. This game is being individually developed in Unity by Jon S. Spitzer. Any feedback or bug reports are greatly appreciated. Current builds can be found on my github at http://www.github.com/XeraRequiem/VR-Disc-Golf.

Future Content:
    Boundaries (+1 for throwing out of bounds)
    Full 9 hole course
    Actual disc assets
    Online multiplayer
    Online leaderboards

Known Bugs:
    Upward throws go further than intended
    
    Sometimes a hole will finish without all player's actually completing the hole. This is being investigated, but has something to do with the comparison function of Unity's GameObjects and the way turns are determined.

    Initial Throw order is incorrect. Player 1 is blue, player 2 is yellow, player 3 is gray, and player 4 is red.
